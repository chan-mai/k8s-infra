  syncPolicy:

      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
    syncOptions:     # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
    - Validate=true # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=true')
    - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
